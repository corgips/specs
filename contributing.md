## 📎 Tools

## 🤝 Code of Conduct
Be respectful. No harassment, gatekeeping, or exclusionary behavior. The Corgi Spec Garden is a space for collaboration and exploration.

---

## ✨ Philosophy
Corgi is not a monolithic standard. It’s a set of shared experiments. You don’t need permission to contribute your vision and knowledge. May your specs be interoperable.
