# C-SPEC-001: Specification Publishing and Governance

## Abstract
This specification defines the structure, lifecycle, and publication process for Corgi garden specifications. It encourages community authorship, versioned modularity, schematic implementation, and a non-authoritative approach to compatibility.

---

## Motivation
To ensure the Corgi ecosystem grows in a resilient, diverse, and collaborative manner, our lightweight but structured spec process helps:
- Encourage experimentation
- Promote discoverability
- Enable compatibility across implementations

---

## Community Norms
- Specs may include descriptions of technical protocols and mechanisms, documentation of experimental work or current best practices.
- Specs are not limited to technical topics and may focus on social and cultural aspects.
- Specs may be entertaining and humorous.
- Multiple competing specs may coexist.
- Compatibility is signaled, not enforced (see `C-COMPAT-001`).
- No endorsement is implied by merging of a particular spec.

---

## Spec Lifecycle
| Status       | Description                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `draft`      | Proposed, open for feedback           |
| `stable`     | Finalized for implementation          |
| `withdrawn`  | Withdrawn, no longer in development   |
| `deprecated` | Superseded or no longer recommended   |

---

## Proposing a Spec
1. Fork this repository.
2. Select a category from ID, COMPAT, DID, ENC, EVENT, SPEC or propose a new one.
3. Create a new Markdown file `c_<category>_<hash_id>.md` in the `specs/` directory. Use `tools/generate-spec-id.py` to generate the hash_id (ex. `C-EVENT-ba2d21f3.md`).

> ðŸ’¡ The `hash_id` is generated by computing the SHA-256 hash of the string:
> `author|short-title|version`, and taking the first 8 characters of the hex digest.

4. Include required metadata at the top:
   ```yaml
   id: spec:@primaryauthor/short-title/v0.1.0
   hash_id: spec:<8-char-sha256-prefix>
   title: Title of the Spec
   authors:
     - @author (or @organization)
     - @anotherauthor
   status: draft
   dateReceived: YYYY-MM-DD
   ```
5. Write your spec:

Every spec should include the following sections:
   - Abstract
   - Motivation
   - Copyright

Following sections may be included in a spec:
   - Specification 
   - Examples
   - Dependencies
6. Submit a pull request with a clear description.

## Corgi Specifications Process 

1. A spec can be submitted by individuals or groups of individuals (authors).
2. Within seven days one of the facilitators will read and respond to the spec. Facilitators check if the spec conforms to the required structure and fits the scope and objective of the garden. Facilitators may request the authors to clarify, justify, or withdraw the spec. Such a request must not reflect the personal bias of facilitators. Rather, it will be made strictly to maintain a high quality of submissions. Facilitators reserve the right to reject a submission when a spec amounts to blatant misuse of the process. The authors may seek feedback from the broader community if a submitted spec is rejected or clarifications are requested.
3. If a facilitator approves a submission it receives the status `DRAFT` and is added to the repository. The facilitator also creates a tracking issue for the spec and adds `trackingIssue` attribute to the spec metadata.
   - Registered specs must have the following metadata attributes: `id`, `hash_id`, `author`, `title`, `version`, `status`, `dateReceived`, `trackingIssue` and `discussionsTo`.
   - When the status is changed to `STABLE`, `WITHDRAWN`, or `DEPRECATED`, the facilitator adds `dateStable`, `dateWithdrawn` or `dateDeprecated` attributes to the spec metadata.
4. While a spec has the status `DRAFT`:
   - Authors are responsible for initiating community discussion and responding to feedback.
   - Authors may submit updates to the spec which will be checked in to the repository by a facilitator. Others may also submit updates with the approval of at least one author.
   - Authors may withdraw the submission upon which a facilitator will set the status of the submission to `WITHDRAWN`.
5. After at least 14 days the authors may request the spec to be finalized. This is done by requesting final comments on the spec.
   - If there are no community objections within 14 days and the authors show that they have initiated sufficient awareness and discussion of the spec, a facilitator will set the status of the submission to `STABLE`.
6. A spec with status `STABLE` can not be updated in a way that would lead to to implementation changes. Minor corrections are allowed.
7. Any substantial change to `STABLE` spec must be submitted with a higher version number or as a new spec.
8. A spec with status `WITHDRAWN` remains in the repository and can be resubmitted.

## Spec ID System
### Option A: Namespaced
```
spec:@alice.vibes/rich-reactions/v1.0.0
```
### Option B: Hash-Based
```
spec:b7c91fa2  # first 8 chars of SHA-256("author|title|version")
```

Hash-based IDs are deterministic and avoid name collisions. Namespaced IDs are easier to read.
### Author / Title Policy
To ensure clarity and consistency:
- Author handles must begin with `@` and use only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), or dots (`.`)
- Examples: `@corgi`, `@alice.vibes`, `@dev-team-42`
- Handles may be personal (`@yourname`) or team-based (`@org.module`)
- The namespace should be globally unique to the contributor or project submitting the spec
- The repo does not enforce uniqueness but (coming soon) will flag duplicates in CI tooling
- Namespaced IDs should use a short title of at most a few lowercase words substituting dashes for spaces.

--- 

## Event Type Discovery
Specs MAY include a `types:` block in their YAML frontmatter, mapping type names to descriptions and schema URIs:

```yaml
types:
  note:
    description: Plain text post
    schema: ./schemas/note.v0.1.0.json
  boost:
    description: Share another event
    schema: ./schemas/boost.v0.1.0.json
```

Schemas are versioned and reference back to their associated specs. This allows clients to introspect, validate, or render events more intelligently.

---

## Optional Tools
- `generate-spec-id.py`: Create hash-based IDs.
- `validate-spec.py`: Check frontmatter data.
- CI validation (coming soon): Check for ID collisions and required metadata.

---

## Dependencies
- None (meta-spec)

---

### Corgi Process Governance

Anyone can propose a change to C-SPEC-001 (or other documents related to the Corgi process) by submitting a pull request that increases the relevant version number(s). A change must be approved by at least two facilitators (one of which could be the submitter). So that the community and facilitators have time to review and provide feedback, at least 30 days must pass before the pull request implementing the change can be merged.

Minor changes (i.e. a correction of a typo or of a broken link) can be accepted immediately after getting approvals from a majority of facilitators.

---

### Facilitators

A list of facilitators is maintained in the `FACILITATORS.md` file at the root of the Corgi spec garden repository.

## History

The process and format described in this spec is influenced by other community driven documentation efforts such as the [BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal Process][BEP-1], [Fediverse Enhancenment Proposal Process][FEP-a4ed], [IETF RFC Series][RFC-8729] and the [Scheme Request for Implementation][SRFI].
