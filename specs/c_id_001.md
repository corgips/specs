# C-ID-001: Delegated Identity & Key Management

## Abstract
This specification defines how identities in Corgi are derived, delegated, and verified using wallet-compatible seeds and scoped subkeys. It enables users to maintain a secure root identity while safely operating through daily-use delegated keys.

This spec outlines how to do that clearly and cryptographically without locking into any particular key derivation method.

---

## Motivation
In a decentralized identity is cryptographic. However, reusing raw private keys is dangerous, and requiring manual signing from wallets and keystores is impractical.

Delegated keypairs enable:
- Scoped and time-limited authority
- Safer everyday use
- Recovery and rotation of compromised or expired subkeys
- Compatibility with existing crypto wallets

---

## Identity Model

### 1. **Root Identity**
- May be derived from a seed phrase (e.g., BIP-39, SLIP-10).
- Public key or DID used as primary identity anchor.
- Rarely used for direct signing.

### 2. **Delegated Keys**
- Ephemeral or device-specific subkeys derived from the root.
- Each comes with a signed delegation proof.

### 3. **Delegation Proof Format**
```json
{
  "delegate_pubkey": "npub1...",
  "delegated_by": "npub_master...",
  "expires_at": 1711111111,
  "scopes": ["post", "react"],
  "sig": "signed_by_master"
}
```

- The payload is signed by the master key.
- Can be embedded in events, shared via profile metadata, or fetched from a DID document.

---

## Event Usage
Events signed with delegated keys must:
- Include the delegation proof (or a reference to it).
- Allow clients and relays to verify the signature chain: `subkey â†’ root`
- Respect `expires_at` and `scopes`

```json
{
  "type": "spec:@corgi/event/v0.1.0#note",
  "created_at": 1710000000,
  "pubkey": "npub_delegated...",
  "content": "gm ðŸŒž",
  "sig": "signed_by_delegated_key",
  "delegation": {
    "delegate_pubkey": "npub_delegated...",
    "delegated_by": "npub_master...",
    "expires_at": 1711111111,
    "scopes": ["post"],
    "sig": "signed_by_master"
  }
}
```

---

## DID Integration (Optional)
If the root identity is a DID:
- The DID document may contain public keys, delegation rules, and revocation lists.
- Enables human-readable names and web-based verification (see `C-DID-001`).

---

## Security Considerations
- Clients should validate `expires_at` and `scopes` before posting.
- Relays should reject expired or invalid delegations.
- Users should rotate delegated keys regularly.

---

## Dependencies
- `C-EVENT-001` (event structure and signature model)
- `C-DID-001` (optional DID integration)
